Printing Both Text and PDF Files On Unix Platforms

In Unix use lpr to print out both text files and PDF files:

Note: on PC-BSD and FreeBSD CUPS is installed as the print server, and CUPS 
supplies replacement utilities for lp and lpr.  However the distro managers 
neglected to remove the old, unconfigured versions of lp and lpr which reside in 
/usr/bin.  The CUPS versions are located in /usr/local/bin, but this folder is 
listed after /usr/bin in the environmental var $PATH, which causes the old 
versions to be invoked rather than the CUPS versions.

This problem is fixed in two steps:

1. Rename all the old lp utilities found in /usr/bin to have an extension like 
“.orig.bak”

    mv /usr/bin/lp lp.old.bak
    mv /usr/bin/lpq lpq.old.bak
    mv /usr/bin/lpr lpr.old.bak
    mv /usr/bin/lprm lprm.old.bak

2. For each user, including Root, edit the ~/.profile script so that the PATH 
string has the folder /usr/local/bin ahead of /usr/bin.

PATH=/usr/local/share/pcbsd/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/games:\$HOME/bin:/usr/local/sbin; export PATH

for details.

Thus, to print text or pdf files from the command line:

[mrathbun@kti-a61 ~]$ lpr /usr/home/mrathbun/KTI/Saved_TreeViews/TTreeView-2.txt
[mrathbun@kti-a61 ~]$ lpr "KTI Profit and Loss Statement, Jan-Dec 2012.pdf"

Printing Text Files On Windows

Text files can easily be sent to a networked printer, by using the Windows lpr 
utility. (This utility needs to be enabled via Control Panel → Add Windows 
Programs)

C:\Junk>lpr -S 192.168.0.243 -P Brother-MFC-9230CW TestBootINI.txt

where values for the IP address and printer name for the networked printer are 
found by typing lpstat -s on a Unix command line:

[mrathbun@kti-a61 ~]$ lpstat -s
system default destination: Brother-MFC-9320CW
device for Brother-MFC-9320CW: socket://192.168.000.243:9100
[mrathbun@kti-a61 ~]$

Alternately, a text file can simply be sent to a physically attached printer by 
using the print command:

C:\Junk>print TestBootINI.txt

Type print /? at the command prompt to learn about print’s options.
Printing PDFs On Windows

PDF files cannot be printed from the Windows command prompt using any of the 
utilities mentioned above for printing out text files.  PDFs must be printed out 
from the command prompt by using any number of free utilities, such as 
Ghostscript, or Foxit Reader, which must be installed specifically.

Here’s how a file was sent to network printer via command prompt using Foxit 
Reader’s command line utility, Foxit Reader.exe (Installed version 614.0217_enu. 
Earlier versions had a bug and would not print to network printers.)

C:\Junk>"C:\Program Files\Foxit Software\Foxit Reader\Foxit Reader.exe" /p LibreOfficeSample.pdf

Using a printer shared via Samba is another way to print which requires a 
different syntax, but not shown in this document.

Note: Be sure to adjust firewall settings to allow access to the network 
printer.
