mycase.in.gov Case Search Format
--------------------------------

(http://www.in.gov/judiciary/2634.htm which explains the case format and how to operate the Odyessy search site.)

Each part of the case number corresponds to information about the case, including the county, court, date filed, and case type:

  57C03-8805-DR-06314

where
  57 = county number
  C03 = court identifier a.k.a. court code
  88 = year
  05 = month
  DR = case type
  06314 = sequence number

According to the above doc, here's some acceptable alternate formats (But it would be best to use the one shown previously):

  
    57C038805DR06314
    57C038805DR6314
    57-C-03-8805-DR-06314

CC--         Civil Collection

(4)    Filing Sequence. The fourth group shall consist of six (6) characters assigned sequentially to a case when it is filed. It shall begin with a “000001” at the beginning of each year for each case classification (or for each docket book or case pool if more than one case classification is grouped within a single docket or case pool) and continue sequentially until the end of the year. No court is required to change to using six (6) characters in the fourth group to the extent that it requires re-programming that court's existing electronic case management system. The same sequence for each case classification (or for each docket book or case pool if more than one case classification is grouped within a single docket or case pool) shall be used in common for all circuit, probate and superior courts within a county using the same case management system. No court is required to use the same sequence in common to the extent that it requires re-programming that court's existing electronic case management system.

(C)   Transferring Cases Between Courts Within County. Whenever a case is transferred between circuit, probate or superior courts within the same county, only the court identifier in the first group of characters in the case number shall be changed. No change shall be made to the fourth group of characters in the case number. The following is an example of how a case number should appear before and after the case has been transferred from one court to another:

55C01-1101-CF-000123 (Case number as it appears in originating court).

55D02-1101-CF-000123 (Case number as it appears in court to which case transferred).

The restriction prohibiting a change to the fourth group of characters does not apply to the extent that implementation of this restriction would require re-programming of the court's existing electronic case management system.

Commentary

          The following changes to the uniform case numbering system shall take effect January 1, 2011:

1.       Administrative Rule 8(2) is amended to require that any case number must contain the month in which a case is filed. (Previously, including the month of filing was optional.) The reason for this change is to facilitate the collection of case filing statistics for periods of time of less than one year.

2.      Administrative Rule 8(4) is amended to require that the fourth group of characters (the "filing sequence") in a case number consist of six (6) characters. (Previously, the filing sequence could contain any number of characters up to six (6)). The reasons for this change are to, first, facilitate on-line searches for cases and, second, achieve greater statewide uniformity in the case numbering system. No court is required to comply with this change to the extent that it would require re-programming of that court's existing electronic case management system. In the process of converting a court's legacy data to a new case management system, the filing sequence may be expanded to consist of six (6) characters.

3.      Administrative Rule 8(4) is further amended to require that the same sequence for each case classification (or for each docket book or case pool if more than one case classification is grouped within a single docket or case pool) shall be used in common for all circuit and superior courts within a county using the same case management system. (Previously, each court could use its own filing sequence). In addition, Administrative Rule 8 is further amended by adding a new paragraph “C” providing that when a case is transferred between any circuit, probate, and superior court in the same county, only the court identifier is to be changed; the filing sequence is to remain the same. The reason for these changes is to facilitate the transfer of cases between courts in the same county. Without this change, two cases may, after a transfer, have the same case number, requiring a new filing sequence to be assigned. For example, under current practice, C Felony cases could be filed in Circuit and Superior Courts in Morgan County under case numbers 55C01-1101-CF-000123 and 55D01-1101-CF-000123. Absent this amendment, if the case in Circuit Court is transferred to Superior Court, there would be two cases in Superior Court with the case number 55C01-1101-CF-000123. This change will also achieve greater statewide uniformity in the case numbering system. No court is required to comply with this change to the extent that it would require re-programming of that court's existing electronic case management system.

Rule 8.1. Uniform Appellate Case Numbering System

(A)    Application. The Clerk of the Supreme Court shall use the uniform case numbering system set forth below for cases filed in the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals and Tax Court.

(B)    Numbering System. The uniform appellate case numbering system shall consist of four groups of characters arranged in a manner to identify the court, the year/month of filing, the case type and the filing sequence. The following is an example of the case number to be employed:

55S00-0804-SJ-001

(1)     Court Identifier. In cases filed in the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals, and in inheritance tax cases and original tax appeals filed in the Tax Court, the first group of five characters shall constitute the county and the court identifier. The first and second character in this group shall represent the county of the court from which the case is being appealed or the original action arose; the county where the original inheritance tax action arose; or the county designated in the written election filed by the taxpayer in an original tax appeal, or otherwise designated as set forth in Indiana Tax Rule 8(A), employing the same code set forth in Administrative Rule 8(B)(1). For the cases noted below, the following topic codes will be used in place of county codes:

93 Appeals from agency actions pursuant to IC 4-21.5-5 et seq.

94 Certified Questions, Rule Amendments, and other miscellaneous matters

98 Disciplinary matters involving out-of-state attorneys.

The third character in the first group shall represent the court in which the proceeding is being filed employing the following codes:

S Supreme Court

A Court of Appeals

T Tax Court

The last two characters of the first group shall distinguish between geographical districts set forth in IC 33-25-1-2 from which the case is being appealed or being assigned in the Court of Appeals, and additional cases and other matters handled by the Supreme Court and the Tax Court, employing the following codes:

00 Administrative/Other matters handled by the Supreme Court, including, but not limited to, Attorney Disciplinary matters, Judicial Disciplinary matters, Special Judge assignments, Senior Judge assignments and Rule amendments.

01 First District: Bartholomew, Boone, Brown, Clark, Clay, Crawford, Daviess, Dearborn, Decatur, Dubois, Fayette, Floyd, Fountain, Franklin, Gibson, Greene, Hancock, Harrison, Hendricks, Henry, Jackson, Jefferson, Jennings, Johnson, Knox, Lawrence, Martin, Monroe, Montgomery, Morgan, Ohio, Orange, Owen, Parke, Perry, Pike, Posey, Putnam, Randolph, Ripley, Rush, Scott, Shelby, Spencer, Sullivan, Switzerland, Union, Vanderburgh, Vermillion, Vigo, Warrick, Washington, and Wayne.

02 Second District: Adams, Blackford, Carroll, Cass, Clinton, Delaware, Grant, Hamilton, Howard, Huntington, Jay, Madison, Marion, Miami, Tippecanoe, Tipton, Wabash, Wells, and White.

03 Third District: Allen, Benton, DeKalb, Elkhart, Fulton, Jasper, Kosciusko, LaGrange, Lake, LaPorte, Marshall, Newton, Noble, Porter, Pulaski, St. Joseph, Starke, Steuben, Warren, and Whitley.

04 The entire state constitutes the Fourth District.

05 The entire state constitutes the Fifth District.

10 Cases appealed to the Tax Court.

(2)    Year/Month of Filing. The second group of four characters shall represent the year and month of filing. As shown above, the first and second characters of this group denote the last two digits of the calendar year and the third and fourth characters reflect the month of filing.

(3)    Case Type. The third group of two characters shall designate the type of proceeding.

i.       The following codes shall be used for matters originating in the Supreme Court:

BL Board of Law Examiners

CQ Certified Questions

DI Attorney Discipline

JD Judicial Discipline

MS Miscellaneous Matters

OR Original Actions

SJ Special Judges

ii.      In appeals, the same case type code used in the lower court, as specified in Administrative Rule 8(B)(3), shall be used except as indicated below:

EX Appeals in certain administrative proceedings

TA Appeals from the Tax Court

DP Direct capital appeals

PD Post-conviction capital appeals

LW Direct Life without Parole (LWOP) appeals

CR Direct appeals (non-capital, non-LWOP)

PC Post-conviction appeals (non-capital)

SD Requests to file successive capital post-conviction petitions

SP Requests to file successive post-conviction petitions (non-capital)

JV Juvenile delinquency appeals with a trial court designation of "JD".

(4)    Filing Sequence. The fourth group may consist of any number of characters assigned sequentially to a case when it is filed. It shall begin with "1" at the beginning of each year for each case classification and continue sequentially until the end of the year. The number of cases filed within a given classification will determine the number of digits in this group.
